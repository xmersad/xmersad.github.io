I started thinking about reading a program from an unconventional type of memory — **paper**.  
It reminded me of punched cards, but since that hardware isn’t available, I went for the next best thing: an A4 sheet.

I wrote a simple C program, compiled it into a binary, and printed its bytes onto paper.  
Then I wrote another program that reads those bytes back through image processing and streams them directly into RAM for execution — without saving them anywhere.  
Everything looked fine until I hit the inevitable **segmentation fault**.

After some digging, I realized the problem was in my assumption: the binary I was trying to execute wasn’t just “pure code.”  
It was an **ELF** binary — a structured file format containing not only executable instructions but also headers and metadata.  
When I loaded the entire ELF image into memory and jumped to it, the CPU started executing header data as code, which obviously caused chaos.  

In a normal boot or program launch, it’s the **ELF loader** that:
- Parses ELF headers  
- Maps loadable segments to proper addresses  
- Performs relocations  
- Applies permissions (read/write/execute)  
- Transfers control to the actual entry point  

By skipping that process, I was effectively trying to run garbage.

### The Fix — Go Flat

Instead of using a full ELF, I generated a **flat binary** — no headers, no metadata, just raw opcodes from the `.text` section.  
Using options like `ld -Ttext=0x0 -nostdlib`, I built a self-contained image that doesn’t depend on libc or startup code.  
Now, the bytes printed on paper represent pure executable instructions.

When the printed data is scanned back:
1. The program reconstructs the binary stream using image processing  
2. Allocates executable memory via `mmap(PROT_EXEC)`  
3. Writes the reconstructed bytes directly into that buffer  
4. Jumps into the buffer — executing code straight from paper  

In this setup, no new process is spawned; the interpreter executes the paper program inline.

### Key Notes

- **ELF ≠ raw code.**  
  The ELF format includes metadata, section tables, and relocations. It cannot be executed by simply loading it into memory and jumping to address zero.

- **Flat binaries work, but they’re minimal.**  
  No startup routines, no libc, no relocations — just bare opcodes. Perfect for controlled experiments, not general-purpose execution.

- **Bit accuracy matters.**  
  One wrong pixel or OCR error can corrupt an instruction. You’ll need robust image recognition or error correction (ECC) if you want this to be reliable.

- **Memory execution permissions.**  
  Modern OSes enforce security like W^X and DEP. Mapping writable+executable memory is restricted, so this should only be done in sandboxed environments.

- **Loader vs Flat.**  
  You can either implement your own ELF loader or work with flat binaries. The former is educational but complex; the latter is simpler but limited.

- **Educational value.**  
  This experiment is not practical but conceptually powerful. It demonstrates the separation between *file format* and *execution image*, and why loaders and linkers are essential.

### Takeaway

Printing a binary and executing it from memory is more than a hack — it’s an exercise in understanding how systems treat code, data, and structure.  
If you want reproducibility, choose one of two paths:
- Implement a lightweight ELF loader  
- Or build position-independent flat binaries  

Both approaches teach you exactly **where execution really begins**.
