Kernel command line is basically a string passed from the bootloader to the kernel to tune behavior or pass settings at boot time.

Some cmdline parameters are *meaningful* to the kernel â€” that means there is a function registered to handle them. Other parameters may be read later by `init` or userspace, or have no special kernel meaning at all. In this post I'll show how to register a custom kernel parameter and process it during boot. The example handles a parameter named `test` and prints its value if present on the kernel command line.

### Implementation (simple)
Add a small handler (for example inside `init/main.c` or another early-init file) and register it with `early_param`. Example:

```c
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>

/* Called early during boot when "test=..." is present on the kernel cmdline */
static int __init parse_test_param(char *arg)
{
    /* arg points to the string after "test=" or is NULL if no value */
    pr_info("cmdline: test=%s\n", arg ? arg : "(empty)");
    return 0; /* return non-zero to signal parse error if needed */
}

/* Register the handler for the "test" kernel parameter */
early_param("test", parse_test_param);
```
## Placement and Build

Place that code in the kernel source (for example, `init/main.c`), rebuild the kernel, and boot it with a command line that includes your custom parameter `test=...`.

## Testing

1. **Build and install the new kernel**

   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   make modules_install
   make modules_install
   ```
2. **Add the parameter to your boot entry (GRUB or your bootloader)**  

   Example entry in GRUB configuration:  

   ```bash
   linux /vmlinuz-... root=/dev/xxx console=ttyS0,115200 test=123 
   ```

3. **Boot the kernel** and check the early boot messages either through a serial console or by running:

    ```bash
    dmesg | grep cmdlind 
    ```
You should see an output like: [    0.123456] cmdline: test=123...

This confirms that the kernel successfully parsed the `test=123` parameter and executed your `early_param` handler during the boot process.  
You can now extend this handler to parse numbers, initialize global variables, or trigger any early configuration logic needed for your specific setup.
