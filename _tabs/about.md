## Hi, I'm Mersad Karimi 

I'm an **Embedded Linux Developer** based in Kermanshah, Iran, specializing in system programming, device driver development, and Linux system integration. My passion lies in building robust, efficient systems for modern embedded devices using cutting-edge tools and open-source technologies.

## What I Do

My work focuses on the fundamental building blocks of embedded Linux systems—from bootloaders and toolchains to kernel customization and root filesystem construction. I believe in understanding systems from the ground up, which is why I prefer building things from scratch rather than relying solely on pre-built solutions.

### Core Expertise

- **Embedded Linux System Development**: Building complete systems from scratch and using build systems like Yocto Project
- **Device Driver Development**: Creating and debugging drivers for various hardware devices
- **System Programming**: Developing reliable C-based applications for both user-space and kernel-space
- **Bootloader Customization**: Deep experience with U-Boot and bootloader configuration
- **Cross-Compilation**: Building toolchains, libraries, and applications for ARM-based platforms like Raspberry Pi
- **IoT Integration**: Combining sensors, protocols, and embedded systems for innovative projects

## Notable Projects

### [BusyPy](https://github.com/xmersad)
A lightweight filesystem written in Python that ships coreutils and system programs without requiring compilation on target devices. This project demonstrates my approach to creating portable, efficient solutions for embedded environments.

### [U-Boot on Web](https://github.com/xmersad)
A web-based interface for configuring U-Boot remotely—no serial connection required. Features real-time AJAX updates, WiFi-enabled board support, and comprehensive documentation for serial pinout and static IP deployment.

### [Embedded Linux Practice](https://github.com/xmersad)
Step-by-step exercises and solutions covering bootloader, rootfs, kernel, and toolchain development with real-world integration examples. A practical resource for anyone learning embedded Linux.

### [Cross-Compiler From Scratch](https://github.com/xmersad)
Automated scripts to produce a complete aarch64 (glibc) cross-toolchain including binutils, GCC stages, Linux headers, and glibc for compiling C/C++ on x86_64 hosts.

## My Approach

I'm a firm believer in hands-on learning and deep technical understanding. Whether it's building a motion-controlled gaming gun with MPU-6050 sensors or implementing dynamic device tree address adjustment in U-Boot, I enjoy tackling challenges that push the boundaries of what embedded systems can do.

My philosophy is simple: understand how things work at a fundamental level, contribute to the open-source community, and continuously expand my expertise through practical projects and real-world problem-solving.

## Education

- **Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering** (2025 - 2027)
- **Associate Degree in Software Engineering** (2023 - 2025)

When I'm not working on embedded systems, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or experimenting with innovative ways to integrate hardware and software. I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects and connect with fellow developers in the embedded systems community.

*Let's build something amazing together!*
